##Dictionary

####This is a ruby method that acts as a dictionary.

This method isn't quite working yet and is in need of some refactoring. However, you're still able to use it if you would like to. To use it, download the zip file and navigate to the file in your terminal. Then run `ruby interface.rb` to bring up the user interface.

We built this project while we were students at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). [This exercise](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/dictionary-go-fish) was meant to introduce us to writing our own ruby methods.
